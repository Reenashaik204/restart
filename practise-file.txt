This is a practise file
Few things i understood in the process: 
 echo "This is a practise file" > practise-file.txt #Echo command not only creates a file but also add info in the file without needing to open vim or nano
First command to enter: git config --global user.name "Nihal"
second need to config email id: git config --global user.email "reenasheikh@gmail.com"
git init # initializes the git
git status 
mkdir example (example named dir is created)
cd example/ (taking us to the example dir from here we can create files)
touch example/first_file_in example #created file in example dir
git add
git commit -m "give some heading to identify the files that you are commiting here"
git status
git checkout master #here master is a branch and we are getting into it
git checkout test # same as above
git remote -v #to check the repositories linked to git bash
git remote add origin https:/give the url from git repo
git remote -v
git push -u origin master
